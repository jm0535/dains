In this chapter, you will:\n\n- Learn various data visualization techniques\n- Gain expertise in creating informative graphs and plots\n- Understand the role of visualization in conveying insights clearly in natural sciences\n\n## The Importance of Data Visualization\n\n### Why Data Visualization Matters\n\nData visualization plays a pivotal role in natural sciences research for several reasons:\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition:** Visualizations make it easier to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. This can reveal phenomena like population fluctuations, species distributions, or the impact of environmental factors.\n\n2. **Communication:** Effective visualizations simplify complex scientific concepts, enabling researchers to convey findings to both expert and non-expert audiences. This is particularly valuable when sharing results with policymakers, stakeholders, or the general public.\n\n3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Visualizations assist in formulating and testing scientific hypotheses. Researchers can visually explore data distributions, relationships, and spatial patterns, which informs the design of hypothesis tests.\n\n4. **Decision-Making:** Visualizations aid in making informed decisions about conservation and management strategies. For example, they can illustrate the effects of different interventions on ecosystem health or agricultural productivity.\n\n### Types of Scientific Data\n\nData in natural sciences come in various forms, including:\n\n1. **Categorical Data:** These represent qualitative characteristics, such as species names, habitat types, or land-use categories. Suitable visualizations include bar charts, pie charts, and stacked bar plots.\n\n2. **Numerical Data:** Numerical data involve measurements or counts, such as temperature, population size, or crop yields. Histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are useful for visualizing numerical data.\n\n3. **Spatial Data:** Spatial data describe the geographical distribution of features. Maps, heatmaps, and spatial plots help visualize these data effectively, allowing researchers to observe spatial patterns and trends.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## PROFESSIONAL TIP: Principles of Effective Scientific Visualization\n\nWhen creating visualizations for scientific publications or presentations:\n\n- **Choose the right plot type**: Match your visualization to your data type and research question\n- **Prioritize clarity over complexity**: A simple, clear visualization is better than a complex, confusing one\n- **Maintain data integrity**: Never distort data through misleading scales, truncated axes, or cherry-picked views\n- **Design for accessibility**: Use colorblind-friendly palettes (viridis, cividis, or ColorBrewer schemes)\n- **Follow journal standards**: Check target journal guidelines for figure specifications before submission\n- **Include uncertainty**: Always visualize error bars, confidence intervals, or other measures of uncertainty\n- **Label thoroughly**: Every axis should have clear labels with units; legends should be comprehensive\n- **Consider the narrative**: Ensure your visualization supports the scientific story you're telling\n- **Create self-contained figures**: A good figure should be interpretable even when separated from the text\n:::\n\n## Creating Basic Plots\n\n### Introduction to Basic Plots\n\nHere's an overview of common basic plots in natural sciences research and when to use them:\n\n1. **Bar Charts:**\n   - **Use:** Bar charts are suitable for visualizing categorical data, such as the frequency of different species in a habitat.\n   - **When to Use:** Use bar charts when comparing the quantities or proportions of different categories. They're great for showing discrete data.\n\n2. **Histograms:**\n   - **Use:** Histograms are ideal for visualizing the distribution of numerical data.\n   - **When to Use:** Use histograms when you want to understand the shape of data distributions, check for skewness, and identify potential outliers.\n\n3. **Scatter Plots:**\n   - **Use:** Scatter plots are valuable for examining relationships between two numerical variables.\n   - **When to Use:** Use scatter plots when you want to see how one variable changes with respect to another. They're helpful for identifying correlations or trends.\n\nThese basic plots serve as building blocks for more advanced visualizations and are foundational tools for exploring and communicating scientific data.\n\nVisualizations not only enhance the understanding of natural phenomena but also foster data-driven decision-making in research and conservation efforts. They allow researchers to uncover insights that might remain hidden in raw data and effectively communicate findings to a wide audience.\n\n### Creating Bar Charts\n\nLet's create a bar chart using the plant biodiversity dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(viridis)  # For colorblind-friendly palettes\n\n# Load the real plant biodiversity dataset from the ecology directory\n# This dataset contains plant conservation data from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\nbiodiversity_data <- read_csv(\"../data/ecology/biodiversity.csv\")\n\n# Create a derived dataset for the visualization by extracting continent and red_list_category\nplant_data <- biodiversity_data %>%\n  # Select the relevant columns for our visualization\n  select(continent, red_list_category) %>%\n  # Rename red_list_category to conservation_status for clarity in the visualization\n  rename(conservation_status = red_list_category) %>%\n  # Filter out any rows with missing values in either column\n  filter(!is.na(continent), !is.na(conservation_status)) %>%\n  # Include only species with a known conservation status\n  filter(conservation_status %in% c(\"Extinct\", \"Extinct in the Wild\", \"Critically Endangered\", \"Endangered\", \"Vulnerable\"))\n\n# Set a professional theme for all plots\ntheme_set(theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  ))\n\n# Create a bar chart of conservation status\nggplot(plant_data, aes(x = continent, fill = conservation_status)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Conservation Status of Plant Species by Region\",\n    x = \"Continent\",\n    y = \"Number of Species\",\n    fill = \"Conservation Status\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar chart showing the conservation status of plant species across different regions.

We first select all columns that start with \"threat_\" (excluding \"threat_NA\") to isolate the threat variables.\n   - We calculate the correlation matrix using `cor()` with `use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\"` to handle missing values.\n   - We convert the correlation matrix to long format for plotting with ggplot2.\n\n2. **Improving Readability**\n   - We create a mapping from technical column names to readable threat descriptions.\n   - We convert the threat variables to factors with proper labels and ordering.\n   - This makes the final visualization much more interpretable.\n\n3. **Creating the Heatmap**\n   - We use `geom_tile()` to create the heatmap cells with white borders for separation.\n   - The `scale_fill_gradient2()` creates a diverging color scale with:\n     - Blue for negative correlations\n     - White for no correlation\n     - Red for positive correlations\n   - We add correlation values as text inside each cell with `geom_text()`.\n   - The text color is conditionally set to white for strong correlations (>0.7 or <-0.7) for better readability.\n\n4. **Visual Styling**\n   - We set specific x-axis breaks at 10-year intervals with `scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1970, 2020, by = 10))`.\n   -

Strongly correlated threats might be addressed through integrated conservation strategies.\n   - Understanding which threats commonly co-occur can help design more effective conservation interventions.\n   - Threats with strong negative correlations might represent different types of human impact that don't typically overlap.\n\n5. **Prioritization**: Threats with many strong positive correlations might represent \"keystone threats\" that, if addressed, could help mitigate multiple related threats simultaneously.\n:::\n\nHeatmaps are particularly valuable in ecological research for visualizing complex correlation matrices, identifying patterns in multivariate data, and revealing clusters of related variables.\n\n### Creating Time Series Plots\n\nTime series plots are essential for visualizing trends over time:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a time series plot using the crop yields data\n# First, read the dataset\ncrop_yields <- read.csv(\"../data/agriculture/crop_yields.csv\")\n\n# Check column names to ensure we're using the correct ones\nwheat_col <- names(crop_yields)[grep(\"Wheat\", names(crop_yields))]\n\n# Create a simplified dataset for time series analysis\n# Select top countries based on data availability\ntop_countries <- crop_yields %>%\n  group_by(Entity) %>%\n  summarize(count = n()) %>%\n  filter(count > 30) %>%\n  arrange(desc(count)) %>%\n  head(6) %>%\n  pull(Entity)\n\n# Create the time series data\ntime_series_data <- crop_yields %>%\n  filter(Entity %in% top_countries) %>%\n  filter(Year >= 1970)\n\n# Create a publication-quality time series plot\n# Use a column that exists in the dataset\nif(length(wheat_col) > 0) {\n  # If we have a wheat column, use it\n  ggplot(time_series_data, aes(x = Year, y = .data[[wheat_col[1]]], color = Entity)) +\n    geom_line(linewidth = 1, na.rm = TRUE) +\n    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.7, na.rm = TRUE) +\n    scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"turbo\", begin = 0.1, end = 0.9) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1970, 2020, by = 10)) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Agricultural Yield Trends Over Time (1970-Present)\",\n      subtitle = \"Productivity changes for major agricultural producers\",\n      x = \"Year\",\n      y = paste(\"Yield\", wheat_col[1]),\n      color = \"Country\",\n      caption = \"Data source: Our World in Data\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n      legend.position = \"right\",\n      panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray90\", linewidth = 0.3),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0)\n    )\n} else {\n  # If no wheat column, use another numeric column\n  numeric_cols <- sapply(time_series_data, is.numeric)\n  numeric_col_names <- names(time_series_data)[numeric_cols]\n\n  if(length(numeric_col_names) > 0) {\n    selected_col <- numeric_col_names[1]\n\n    ggplot(time_series_data, aes(x = Year, y = .data[[selected_col]], color = Entity)) +\n      geom_line(linewidth = 1, na.rm = TRUE) +\n      geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.7, na.rm = TRUE) +\n      scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"turbo\", begin = 0.1, end = 0.9) +\n      labs(\n        title = \"Agricultural Trends Over Time (1970-Present)\",\n        subtitle = \"Changes for major agricultural producers\",\n        x = \"Year\",\n        y = selected_col,\n        color = \"Country\",\n        caption = \"Data source: Our World in Data\"\n      ) +\n      theme(\n        legend.position = \"right\",\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray90\", linewidth = 0.3)\n      )\n  } else {\n    # If no suitable numeric column found\n    plot(1:10, 1:10, type = \"n\", axes = FALSE, xlab = \"\", ylab = \"\")\n    text(5, 5, \"No suitable numeric data found for time series plot\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time series plot tracking agricultural trends over time for major producers. The visualization illustrates long-term productivity changes and allows comparison between countries.](06-visualization_files/figure-html/time-series-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n#### R Code Explanation\n\nThis code creates a time series plot to visualize agricultural yield trends over time for major producing countries. Let's break down the key components:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**\n   - We first load the crop yields dataset and identify the column containing wheat yield data using pattern matching with `grep()`.\n   - We select the top countries based on data availability by counting observations per country, filtering for those with more than 30 data points, and taking the top 6.\n   - We filter the data to focus on the period from 1970 to the present for a more recent historical perspective.\n\n2. **Robust Code Design**\n   - The code includes conditional logic to handle potential data structure variations:\n     - If a wheat yield column exists, we use it for the visualization.\n     - If not, we fall back to another numeric column.\n     - If no suitable numeric columns exist, we display a message.\n   - This approach makes the code more robust when working with datasets that might have different structures.\n\n3. **Creating the Time Series Plot**\n   - We use `geom_line()` to connect data points across years, with `linewidth = 1` for visibility.\n   - We add `geom_point()` to highlight individual data points, with slight transparency (`alpha = 0.7`).\n   - The `na.rm = TRUE` parameter ensures that missing values don't break the lines or points.\n   - We use the \"turbo\" color palette from the viridis package to distinguish between countries.\n\n4. **Enhancing Readability**\n   - We set specific x-axis breaks at 10-year intervals with `scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1970, 2020, by = 10))`.\n   - We add informative title, subtitle, axis labels, and a data source caption.\n   - We include subtle grid lines to aid in reading values across years.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n#### Interpretation\n\nTime series plots reveal important temporal patterns:\n\n1. **Long-term Trends**: The overall trajectory of agricultural yields shows whether productivity is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.\n\n2. **Rate of Change**: The slope of the lines indicates how rapidly yields are changing, which may reflect technological advances, policy changes, or environmental factors.\n\n3. **Country Comparisons**: Differences between countries highlight variations in agricultural practices, technology adoption, or environmental conditions.\n\n4. **Anomalies and Events**: Sudden drops or spikes in the data might correspond to extreme weather events, economic crises, or policy changes.\n\n5. **Convergence or Divergence**: We can observe whether the gap between high and low-yielding countries is narrowing or widening over time.\n\nTime series plots are particularly valuable in ecological and agricultural research for:\n- Tracking changes in species populations, biodiversity metrics, or ecosystem services over time\n- Monitoring environmental variables like temperature, precipitation, or pollution levels\n- Analyzing seasonal patterns and phenological shifts\n- Evaluating the effects of conservation interventions or policy changes\n- Forecasting future trends based on historical patterns\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### Professional Tip\n\n## Best Practices for Data Visualization\n\n### Choosing the Right Visualization\n\nSelecting the appropriate visualization depends on your data and the story you want to tell:\n\n1. **For Comparing Categories:**\n   - Bar charts for comparing values across categories\n   - Grouped or stacked bar charts for comparing multiple variables across categories\n\n2. **For Showing Distributions:**\n   - Histograms for showing the distribution of a single variable\n   - Box plots for comparing distributions across groups\n   - Violin plots for showing distribution shape along with summary statistics\n\n3. **For Showing Relationships:**\n   - Scatter plots for examining relationships between two variables\n   - Bubble charts for examining relationships among three variables\n   - Heatmaps for visualizing complex relationships in multivariate data\n\n4. **For Showing Compositions:**\n   - Pie charts for showing parts of a whole (use sparingly)\n   - Stacked bar charts for showing composition across categories\n   - Area charts for showing composition over time\n\n5. **For Showing Trends:**\n   - Line charts for showing changes over time\n   - Area charts for showing cumulative totals over time\n\n### Design Principles for Effective Visualization\n\nFollow these principles to create clear, informative visualizations:\n\n1. **Simplicity:** Keep visualizations simple and focused on the main message. Avoid unnecessary elements that can distract from the data.\n\n2. **Clarity:** Ensure that your visualization clearly communicates the intended message. Use appropriate labels, titles, and annotations.\n\n3. **Accuracy:** Represent data accurately. Avoid distorting the data through inappropriate scales or misleading visual elements.\n\n4. **Consistency:** Use consistent colors, shapes, and styles throughout your visualizations for better comprehension.\n\n5. **Color Use:** Choose colors thoughtfully. Use color to highlight important aspects of your data, but be mindful of color blindness and cultural associations.\n\n6. **Annotation:** Add context through appropriate annotations, explaining unusual patterns or important events.\n\n7. **Audience Consideration:** Tailor your visualizations to your audience's knowledge level and needs.\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\nBe aware of these common visualization mistakes:\n\n1. **Misleading Scales:** Starting y-axes at values other than zero can exaggerate differences.\n\n2. **Overcomplication:** Adding too many variables or visual elements can confuse rather than clarify.\n\n3. **Poor Color Choices:** Using colors that are difficult to distinguish or that carry unintended connotations.\n\n4. **Ignoring Accessibility:** Not considering color blindness or other accessibility issues.\n\n5. **Inappropriate Chart Types:** Using chart types that don't match the data or the story you want to tell.\n\n6. **Missing Context:** Failing to provide necessary context for interpreting the visualization.\n\n7. **Neglecting Uncertainty:** Not showing confidence intervals, error bars, or other indicators of uncertainty.\n\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\nEffective data visualization is a powerful tool for both exploring data and communicating findings. By choosing the right visualization techniques and following best practices, you can gain deeper insights from your data and share those insights with others in a compelling way.\n\nIn this chapter, we've explored:\n- The importance of data visualization in natural sciences\n- Basic visualization techniques including bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots\n- Advanced visualization methods like box plots, heatmaps, and time series plots\n- Best practices and principles for creating effective visualizations\n\nBy applying these techniques to real datasets from agriculture, ecology, and geography, we've demonstrated how visualization can reveal patterns and relationships that might otherwise remain hidden in the raw data.\n\n## Exercises\n\n1.
